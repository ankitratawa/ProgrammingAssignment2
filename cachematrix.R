## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the
## cachesolve will retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
	inv <- x$getinv()
	if(!is.null(inv)) {
		message("getting cached data")
		return(inv)
	}
	data <- x$get()
	inv <- solve(data)
	x$setinv(inv)
	inv
}
